# Booting with an ISO

## Burning a CD/DVD

To create a bootable CD-ROM/DVD, burn the ISO image [netboot.xyz.iso](https://boot.netboot.xyz/ipxe/netboot.xyz.iso) to a blank CD-ROM/DVD. Insert the media into the server, set the proper boot order and boot up.

## Virtual Machine Software

You can also use these ISOs to boot any sort of VM in Citrix XenServer, VMware ESXi, VMware Fusion, VirtualBox.

## Out of Band Virtual Media

They are great for attaching to remote virtual media of a server like the Dell DRAC or HP iLOs. Because the iPXE boot disk is so light weight, they are great for starting installations where there might be really low bandwidth.
