# Packet

[Packet](https://packet.net) fully supports netboot.xyz with its Custom iPXE operating system.

## Usage

Select the "Custom iPXE" operating system from the portal, or the `custom_ipxe` slug when using the API.

## Provisioning

Put the netboot.xyz URL in the text field that appears in the portal, or use the `ipxe_script_url` parameter when creating the device via the API.

```text
https://boot.netboot.xyz
```

Press "Deploy" to provision your device. It will take 2-3 minutes for the device to become active. Once it's online, connect to Packet's out-of-band serial-over-SSH service \(S.O.S.\) using the device's `id` and the facility where the device was deployed, e.g. `ewr1`.

```text
ssh <device-id>@sos.<facility-code>.packet.net
```

The current list of facilities is [here](https://www.packet.net/locations/). The netboot.xyz iPXE menu will appear and you can complete installation from there.

> **Please Note:** By default, devices are set to boot from the local disk. During provisioning, Packet sets the next boot to PXE. This happens once, which means that if you don't install an operating system before rebooting, it won't reload the netboot.xyz menu. However, you can set your device to always boot to iPXE first by enabling that option under 'server actions' through the customer portal.

## Networking

Devices that are provisioned via Custom iPXE will be able to DHCP for the life of the device; however, Packet recommends configuring networking statically. IP address information can be found by querying [https://metadata.packet.net/metadata](https://metadata.packet.net/metadata) from the host.

More information on how Packet configures bonding can be found [here](https://www.packet.net/help/kb/how-does-the-packet-bonded-network-interface-work/).

Nameservers should be configured as:

```text
nameserver 147.75.207.207
nameserver 147.75.207.208
```
